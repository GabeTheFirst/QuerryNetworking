# Querry Networking
I an once again making a random online game, but I decided instead of just making another server, I would just make some kind of framework for creating servers

There isn't too many features yet, but here's how to use it:

To start the server you need to be using QuerryNetworking.Core;
Before you run Api.StartServer(); you need to run Api.SetupBase();

```can I write code like this?```
